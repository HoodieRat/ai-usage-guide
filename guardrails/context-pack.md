# Context pack brief

Share these files before requesting code changes so ChatGPT has project awareness:

- `context/file-tree.txt`
- `context/call-graph.json`
- `context/dead-code.json`
- `context/signatures.csv`

Paste their contents into the chat (or supply download links) alongside the Idea -> Project Structure prompt. Update the files whenever the repository layout or APIs change.
